You are a FACS expert. Generate a facial expression animation JSON file from the following description, considering Ortony, Collins, Clore (OCC) emotions.

Instructions: Output a single JSON object with the following fields:
1) “duration”: estimated animation duration in seconds
2) “emotion”: name of the OCC emotion
3) “facial_actions”: list of facial Action Units and AUs 51 to 64 for head and eye movement. Each AU should be a dictionary with:
- “AU”: the AU number (e.g., 1, 12, 17, 51, etc.)
- “Times”: list of key time points (starting at 0, ending
at duration)
- “Intensities”: list of values (0–100) matching Times
Requirements:
- Match emotional expressivity and timing to the described
scenario.
- Do not include any other text outside the JSON object.
- Use valid JSON syntax with double quotes, arrays, and no
trailing commas.
- Ensure all lists are the same length and well-formed.
